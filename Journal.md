I feel so confused when I read the syllabus because the sites mentioned by the professor are strange to me.
I don't even hear or know about GitHub, or hypothesis before. 
But I still would like to try to figure out how to use them,
and I feel great typing in Github because I never use it before, 
and it is gonna be an amazing journey for me during my academic year. 
Even though I am not sure if I am using this website correctly. 

I don't encounter any problems when I was setting up the GitHub because the professor provided me with clear instructions of how to get started with the GitHub,
and every step is clear to follow. So it only costs me about 2-5 minutes to get everything done on Github.

but I did have problems when I reached the Hypothesis. 
After I registered the Hypothesis, tried to install it into the google chrome. 
I clicked the small H mark on the right corner of my screen which represented the Hypothesis, 
but it won't take me to the website. 

it showed "Hypothesis doesn't work on this page. 
This extension can only be used on pages where the URL starts with "http:", "https:" or "file:".

If you have a Chrome extension installed that provides a custom viewer for PDFs or other file types, 
that may prevent them from being annotated with Hypothesis." 

I tried another way that if I want to add any annotations of the text, the hypothesis will appear on the right side of my screen
automatically. 

Above are my short experiences of how I started to use Github and Hypothesis, I am looking forward to use these plarforms more 
in the future.
