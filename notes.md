New terms I encountered:


respository: it is used to organized a single project. Respository can contain folder, files, images and so on. 


Branching: it is a way to work on different versions of a respository at one time.


digital humanities: my understanding of this term is a combination of ditial work and the humanities study. The digital tools such
as computer, digital media
can also be used in the anthropology filed.


Error Message I found:

When I was trying to installed the Hypothesis into my Chrome, the website showed:
We’re sorry, Hypothesis doesn’t work on this page…
This extension can only be used on pages where the URL starts with "http:", "https:" or "file:".

I found out that when I try to add annotations of the text, it will appear on the right screen automatically, 
no need to clik the small hypothesis on purpose.
